    - how did you implement it?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

implement
- the Login Functionality in the index.html page 
- the Logout Functionality in the app.html
- create a new app.js for the app.html page
- do the same logic we did with the signup button in the index.html
    - we added an event listener to call a custom function we created in auth.js

- create two more custom function inside auth.js to take care of calling the corresponding login and logout from firebase
