HW 10 submission document
- learnings from this assignment
    -> it is very important to know which function goes in which JS file
- what was easy?
    -> implelemting the fucntions from Firebase documentation
- what was challenging?
    -> figuring out which JS file will have the documentation functions and which file will have the event listener
    -> next time, i will use only one JS file as a beginner
- what is onAuthStateChanged
    -> it checks the authorization state of a logged in user
    -> it makes sure that the page is only visible once a user has logged in
- how did you implement it
    -> i followed a tutorial by Aaron Dunn
    -> he details how to use Firebase for authentication
    -> he uses terminal for installation for some functionality, but i implemented script only
    -> it was easy to follow, but it was hard to compare which part of the code goes in which file
    -> he only had one main.js file, detailing which function should be written before the event listener or such
